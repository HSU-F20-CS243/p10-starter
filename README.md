# Project 10 Starter Code
This code must serve as the foundation of your project 10 submission.  I suggest completing the assignment in the following order:

## JackTokenFactory.hpp
Complete JackTokenFactory so that it returns a correctly constructed token for the supplied text input.  

## CompilerFactory.cpp
Once your tokens are properly constructed, next work on building the CompilerFactory.  This factory should create the necessary Compiler class based on the nature of the next token.  I provided a starting example on line 25 of the file.

## All *Compiler.hpp classes
Using Figure 10.5 from the book as a guide, flesh out each compiler classes.  I provide you with a fully completed ClassCompiler.hpp that you can use as a guide for the rest of the classes.
